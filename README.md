# Individual hand-in assignment: Test Driven Development

This repo is an example walkthrough of the first individual Hand-in assignment in T-SRAD-233, spring semester 2020.

## Getting started

1. Create a virtual environment
   - On Windows: `py -m venv env`
   - On MacOS/Linux: `python3 -m venv env`
2. Activate the virtual env:
   - On Windows: `.\env\Scripts\activate` (in Powershell)
   - On MacOS/Linux: `.env/Scripts/activate`
3. Install the requirements:
   - `pip install -r requirements`

## Running tests

Simply run the following command: `pytest` with the virtual environment activated. Note that currently there are no tests in the repository.
